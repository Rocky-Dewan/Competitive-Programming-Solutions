## Mission & Philosophy

Welcome to the **Algorithm & Data Structure Implementation Vault!**

This repository is dedicated to creating a **free, open, and high-quality resource** for mastering the fundamental building blocks of computer science: **Algorithms and Data Structures (DSA)**.

Our goal is simple: to provide clean, efficient, and well-explained implementations across multiple programming languages. Whether you are a student, a competitive programmer, or a professional looking to refresh your knowledge, this vault is here to help you **learn, implement, and distribute.**

> **This resource is free for everyone to use, learn from, and share.** We firmly believe that foundational knowledge should be accessible to all.
